    "Broadcasting in NumPy allows arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes by \"stretching\" the smaller array along the missing dimensions so the shapes become compatible. Broadcasting follows specific rules — it does not actually copy data in memory, but behaves as if the smaller array were replicated to match the larger shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broadcasting rules (summary):\n",
    "1. If arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the smaller array is left-padded with ones until both shapes have the same length.\n",
    "2. Arrays are compatible in a dimension if they are equal in that dimension or one of them is 1.\n",
    "3. If all dimensions are compatible, broadcasting is possible and the result shape is the maximum along each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate these rules with examples."
