    "# 12. Broadcasting in NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Broadcasting in NumPy refers to the ability of NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes. Instead of throwing an error when dimensions do not match, NumPy stretches or “broadcasts” the smaller array across the larger one so that compatible operations can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting makes code more efficient by removing the need for manual looping and reshaping. It is used extensively in data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When Broadcasting Works\n",
    "NumPy compares the shapes of arrays starting from the last dimension and moves backward. Two dimensions are compatible if:\n",
    "1. They are equal, or\n",
    "2. One of them is 1\n",
    "\n",
    "If both conditions fail, broadcasting cannot be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Array A shape: (3, 1)\n",
    "Array B shape: (1, 4)\n",
    "Both can broadcast to shape: (3, 4)\n",
